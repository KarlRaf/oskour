              THE FOX AND THE CROW
            </h2>
            <p>
             One bright morning as the Fox was following his sharp nose through the wood in search of a bite to eat, he saw a Crow on the limb of a tree overhead. This was by no means the first Crow the Fox had ever seen. What caught his attention this time and made him stop for a second look, was that the lucky Crow held a bit of cheese in her beak.
              "No need to search any farther," thought sly Master Fox. "Here is a dainty bite for my breakfast."
              Up he trotted to the foot of the tree in which the Crow was sitting, and looking up admiringly, he cried, "Good-morning, beautiful creature!"
              The Crow, her head cocked on one side, watched the Fox suspiciously. But she kept her beak tightly closed on the cheese and did not return his greeting.
              "What a charming creature she is!" said the Fox. "How her feathers shine! What a beautiful form and what splendid wings! Such a wonderful Bird should have a very lovely voice, since everything else about her is so perfect. Could she sing just one song, I know I should hail her Queen of Birds."
              Listening to these flattering words, the Crow forgot all her suspicion, and also her breakfast. She wanted very much to be called Queen of Birds.
              So she opened her beak wide to utter her loudest caw, and down fell the cheese straight into the Fox's open mouth.
              "Thank you," said Master Fox sweetly, as he walked off. "Though it is cracked, you have a voice sure enough. But where are your wits?"

              THE WOLF, THE KID, AND THE GOAT
            </h2>
            <p>
             Mother Goat was going to market one morning to get provisions for her household, which consisted of but one little Kid and herself.
              "Take good care of the house, my son," she said to the Kid, as she carefully latched the door. "Do not let anyone in, unless he gives you this password: 'Down with the Wolf and all his race!'"
              Strangely enough, a Wolf was lurking near and heard what the Goat had said. So, as soon as Mother Goat was out of sight, up he trotted to the door and knocked.
              "Down with the Wolf and all his race," said the Wolf softly.
              It was the right password, but when the Kid peeped through a crack in the door and saw the shadowy figure outside, he did not feel at all easy.
              "Show me a white paw," he said, "or I won't let you in."
              A white paw, of course, is a feature few Wolves can show, and so Master Wolf had to go away as hungry as he had come.
              "You can never be too sure," said the Kid, when he saw the Wolf making off to the woods.

              THE LION, THE ASS, AND THE FOX

            <p>
             A Lion, an Ass, and a Fox were hunting in company, and caught a large quantity of game. The Ass was asked to divide the spoil. This he did very fairly, giving each an equal share.
              The Fox was well satisfied, but the Lion flew into a great rage over it, and with one stroke of his huge paw, he added the Ass to the pile of slain.
              Then he turned to the Fox.
              "You divide it," he roared angrily.
              The Fox wasted no time in talking. He quickly piled all the game into one great heap. From this he took a very small portion for himself, such undesirable bits as the horns and hoofs of a mountain goat, and the end of an ox tail.
              The Lion now recovered his good humor entirely.
              "Who taught you to divide so fairly?" he asked pleasantly.
              "I learned a lesson from the Ass," replied the Fox, carefully edging away
